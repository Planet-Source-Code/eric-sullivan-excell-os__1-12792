### Description

Hello fellow VB Programmers. This is a project i have been working on, on and off in my

spare time. This is nowhere near finished, but i thought i should get some feedback to

know if i am just wasting my time or not. <br>

<br>

This is a fake Operating System (But almost completly dependent on itself), that has such

options as:<br>

<li>drag and drop<br>

<li>creating new folders (can't open them yet)<br>

<li>Taskbar (Needs lots of work)<br>

<li>Recycling Bin<br>

<li>File Renaming<br>

<li>And More!

<br><br>

If this project gets good feedback i would like to do lots more so PLEASE VOTE!
